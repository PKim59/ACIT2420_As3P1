## Creating your own web server

1. Register for a digitalocean account. Please create an account at https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new.

2. Once you have a digitalocean account and are logged in, select **New Project** in the side panel to the left.

3. Enter a name, description and  select one of the options from the dropdown menu for the third field and then click **Create Project**. 

4. Click **Skip for now** at the bottom of the page, as we don't have any resources to enter into the project.

5. You will see your newly made project page. Now, we can add a server to this project. At the top of the page, click the **Create** button and then click **Droplets**.

6. In the **Create Droplets** page, select the region closest to you (for us, it should be San Francisco).

7. In the **Choose an image** section, click on the icon named **Debian** and has the Debian icon, select **Basic**, click **Premium AMD** and then click the lowest cost option beneath it (currently, it is the **$7/mo** option).
